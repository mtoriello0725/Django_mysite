# My Personal Website!

#### My personal website deployed on heroku. __mtoriello0725.herokuapp.com__

This website is built using the Python framework Django. The landing page has my picture, a navigation bar, and a short biography of me. If the user would like to read more, the biography can extend.

There is a blog section, where I discuss the various projects I have worked on. In these posts, I go over everything from:
- Why I decided to make the project
- Software used
- Snapshots of application/graphics
- Conclusions & what I leaerned

There is also a contact page, which simply informs the user of my email address and phone number.

I would like to thank the following YouTube series for providing very informative tutorials:
